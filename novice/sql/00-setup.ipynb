To be able to follow the instructions, you need to know how to move around in your directory using the command line and how to execute commands from the command line. If you are not familiar with these topics, please read the [Unix Shell guide](http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/shell/index.html). In a later chapter, you will learn how to create and fill a database, but first we would like to demonstrate how an SQLite database works and therefore we provide the database up-front."
